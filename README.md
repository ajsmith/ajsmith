Hi, I'm @ajsmith and welcome to my Github space. Here you'll find a
small collection of personal projects.

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at Capital One. I'm also a PhD student
in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at George Mason
University.

My favorite programming languages are Python and Haskell. I love open
source software and Linux.

For fun, I'm into gaming. I like Dungeons & Dragons and
Pathfinder. For video games, my recent favorites are mostly indie
titles like RimWorld, Factorio, and Darkest Dungeon.

Feel free to say hi if you're interested in my work or want to
collaborate! I can be reached at
